3. Profiling
a) Profiling of the code shows that matrix multiplications are the most time consuming steps (line 26 and 27 of the original matmult.py file).
   The lines at which appending is applied are most memory consuming (line 10, 15 and 20).
b) Lines 10, 11, 13, 25, 26, 29 could be optimized since they are time consuming, but especially line 53 contributes (the factorize function) should be optimized.
   This line also is most memory consuming.
c) Applying numpy improves the code approximatly 100fold.
